# Project 2 2021

## Background
In recent years, computer disk sizes and densities have increased dramatically, with costs dropping to 4c/gigabyte (HDD) and 14c/gigabyte (SSD). As a consequence, we store files on our computers' disks in very different ways and, because we typically have a huge amount of free space available, we end up having multiple copies of many files on our disks. This presents few problems, until we eventually run out of disk space, or need to transfer files to more expensive cloud-storage, perhaps over a network with limited bandwidth. At that time we'd like to locate all duplicate files, and only make one copy of them to our backup destination.

    The goal of this project is to design and develop a command-line utility program, named duplicates, 
    to locate and report duplicate files in, and below, a named directory.
 
    Successful completion of the project will develop and enhance your understanding of advanced features of 
    the C11 programming language, and core Linux operating system system-calls and POSIX function calls.


There are two parts to the project:

1. The basic version requires you to develop a working program with a restricted set of features. It is possible to receive full marks for the project by only completing the basic version.
2. ðŸŒ¶ If you would like a greater challenge, you may like to attempt the advanced version of this project. Undertaking and completing significant parts of the advanced tasks provides the opportunity to recover any marks not awarded for the basic version of the project.

## Program invocation
Your implementation of duplicates will be invoked with zero or more valid command-line options, and one directory name. With no command-line options (i.e. only a directory name is provided) duplicates will simply list 4 things (with just one integer per line):

1. the total number of files found,
2. the total size (in bytes) of all files found,
3. the total number of unique files (i.e. any duplicate is only counted once), and
4. the possible minimum total size of all files found (i.e. the sizes of duplicated files are only counted once). 

Files and directories (other than the "starting" directory indicated on the command-line) which cannot be read should be silently ignored (no error messages should be printed).
For the basic project, the "starting" directory will only contain regular files and sub-directories. In particular, there will be no hard- or symbolic-links. Your project is required to support the following command-line options and, if attempting the advanced version of the project, command-line options marked with a chili ðŸŒ¶.

## Detecting duplicate files

- Two or more files are defined to be duplicates iff their contents are identical - duplicate files will thus have the same size, but we're unconcerned about the files' names or their modification times.
- A file is defined to be unique iff no other file has the same contents. 

To detect duplicate files we'll employ a cryptographic hash function named SHA2 (pronounced 'shar-2') [Wikipedia] and [Youtube]. SHA2 examines the contents of a file and produces a fixed-length summary of its contents. Cryptographic hash functions are designed by mathematicians and those developing encryption and security software.

Here is an implementation of the function strSHA2.c which you may (should) use without attribution.

Two or more files are considered identical if their cryptographic hashes are identical. For this project, we'll use a C11 string to store this representation, and two files will be considered identical if their SHA2 string representations are identical. The function strSHA2(), with the following prototype:

    char *strSHA2(char *filename);

is provided for this project (it is not a standard C11 function). If strSHA2 can read the indicated file, it will returned a dynamically allocated string holding the SHA2 string representation of the file's contents. If the indicated file cannot be read, strSHA2 will return NULL. Note that you do not have to understand the SHA2 algorithm or its strSHA2() implementation for this project.

## Getting started
There is no required sequence of steps to undertake the project, and no sequence of steps will guarantee success. However, the following sequence is strongly recommended (and this is how the sample solution was built). It is assumed (considered essential for success!) that each step:

- is extensively tested before you proceed to the next step, and
- reports any errors to stderr as they are found. Serious errors may require the whole program to terminate. 

The recommended steps:

0. find a project partner.
1. determine what activities are to be performed by the program. Determine what data needs to be stored during the execution of the program. Design one of more data types and data structures to store this long-term data, and create a new duplicates.h header file to define these constructs.
2. break up the activities into fairly independent sets. Write a number of "empty" C files, each of which includes your duplicates.h header file, to implement the activities. Ensure that your file implementing the main() function is named duplicates.c.
3. write a Makefile to compile and link your C files, each of which will be dependent on the header file.
4. write the main() function, whose initial task is simply to receive and validate the command-line options and arguments. Write a usage() function to report the program's synopsis, should command-line processing detect any errors.
5. ensure that the "real" command-line argument is the name of a directory that you can read it.
6. open and read each directory, locating all regular files in the directory. At this stage (as a debugging aid) just print each filename as it is found. When directories are located within directories, you should process those directories recursively.
7. add support for the -a command-line option when finding files.
8. store the name (location) and size of each file found in each directory.
9. having finished reading the directories, identify all duplicate files.
10. if the -q command-line option is provided, perform its role and terminate.
11. if no command-line options are provided, print out the required "statistics" about the files found and terminate.
12. if the -l command-line option is provided, perform its role and terminate.
13. armed with a fully tested program, and overflowing with confidence, consider of the advanced tasks (described below). 

**It is anticipated** that a successful project will use (some of) the following Linux system-calls, and standard C11 & POSIX functions: 

getopt(), malloc(), realloc(), free(), opendir(), readdir(), closedir(), stat(), and perror();   link()ðŸŒ¶, and unlink();ðŸŒ¶,   strdup(), and strSHA2() (neither are part of the C11 standard).

## Advanced tasks
ðŸŒ¶ If you would like a greater challenge, you may like to attempt to an advanced version of this project. Undertaking and completing significant parts of the advanced tasks provides the opportunity to recover any marks not awarded for the basic version of the project.

There are 3 additional tasks in the advanced section:

1. support duplicate detection in and below two or more directories provided on the command-line. For example, if four directory names are provided, then all files in all four directories should be considered.

2. support the presence of hard-links (but not symbolic-links) in the directories being considered. When counting the total number of bytes occupied by all files, the "contents" of all files hard-linked together are counted only once.

3. support the -m command-line option.
This task requires you to identify duplicate files and to then store only one instance of each (with possibly different names). The Linux link() system call (see man 2 link) provides this facility for us, by creating hard-links between two or more files. The actual file contents will only be stored only once, and multiple relative pathnames will refer to that single copy.

WARNING: until you are very confident that your duplicates program is working correctly, you are strongly advised NOT to use your duplicates program to use the -m option to minimize the storage of important files and directories!

## Project requirements

1. Your project must be developed in multiple C11 source files and (at least one) header file.

2. Your submission will be compiled with the C11 compiler arguments -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -pedantic, and marks will not be awarded if your submission does not compile.

3. Compilation and linking of your project must be supported by a Makefile, containing approriate variable definitions and automatic variables.

4. The default target of your Makefile must be named duplicates, and invocation of the make command must produce an executable program named duplicates.

5. Your project must employ sound programming practices, including the use of meaningful comments, well chosen identifier names; appropriate choice of basic data-structures, data-types, and functions; and appropriate choice of control-flow constructs.

## Assessment
The project is due at **11:59pm Friday 22nd October (end of week 12)**, and is worth **25% of your final mark** for CITS2002.

It will be marked out of 50. The project may be completed **individually or in teams of two** (but not teams of three). The choice of project partners is up to you - you will not be automatically assigned a project partner.

You are strongly advised to work with another student who is around the same level of understanding and motivation as yourself. This will enable you to discuss your initial design together, and to assist each other to develop and debug your joint solution. Work together - do not attempt to split the project into two equal parts, and then plan to meet near the deadline to join your parts together.

25 of the possible 50 marks will come from the correctness of your solution. The remaining 25 marks will come from your programming style, including your use of meaningful comments; well chosen identifier names; appropriate choice of basic data-structures, data-types and functions; and appropriate choice of control-flow constructs.

During the marking, attention will obviously be given to the correctness of your solution. However, a correct and efficient solution should not be considered as the perfect, nor necessarily desirable, form of solution. Preference will be given to well presented, well documented solutions that use the appropriate features of the language to complete tasks in an easy to understand and easy to follow manner. That is, do not expect to receive full marks for your project simply because it works correctly. Remember, a computer program should not only convey a message to the computer, but also to other human programmers.

## Submission requirements

    The deadline for the project is 11:59pm Friday 22nd October (end of week 12).

    You must submit your project electronically using cssubmit.

    You should submit ALL C11 source-code (*.c) and header (*.h) files and a Makefile that specify the steps 
    required to compile and link your application. You do not need to submit any data files/directories or testing 
    scripts that you used while developing and testing your project. You can submit multiple files in one submission 
    by first archiving them with zip or tar.

    The cssubmit program will display a receipt of your submission. You should print and retain this receipt in case of any dispute. 
    Note also that cssubmit does not archive submissions and will simply overwrite any previous submission with your latest submission.
    At least one of your submission's C11 source files must contain C11 block comment:


    //  CITS2002 Project 2 2021
    //  Name(s):             student-name1 (, student-name2)
    //  Student number(s):   student-number1 (, student-number2)

    If working as a team, only one team member should make the team's submission.

    Your submission will be examined, compiled, and tested on a contemporary Ubuntu Linux system. 
    Your submission should work as expected on this platform. While you may develop your project on other computers, 
    excuses such as "it worked at home, just not when you tested it!"  will not be accepted.

    This project is subject to UWA's Policy on Assessment - particularly Â§5.3 Principles of submission and penalty for late submission. 
    In accordance with this policy, you may discuss with other students the general principles required to understand this project, 
    but the work you submit must be the result of your own efforts. All projects will be compared using software that detects 
    significant similarities between source code files. Students suspected of plagiarism will be interviewed and will be required 
    to demonstrate their full understanding of their project submission. 

Clarifications
Please post requests for clarification about any aspect of the project to help2002 so that all students may remain equally informed. If necessary, the main project page will be updated to clarify any English in the project's description. Make reference to the online copy, and not a (dated) paper copy.

Good luck!

Amitava Datta and Chris McDonald.
