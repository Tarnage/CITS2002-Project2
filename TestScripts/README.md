To run it you need to:

- expand the ZIP file into a new directory
- copy your Makefile, *.c and *.h files into the subdirectory named 'submission' 
- run  'make'  to execute the automated tests
- run  'make tee'  to capture the marker's output in  'marker-output.txt'
- uncomment a line at about line 60 of marker.sh for less verbose output
